# GLAW · The Open-Source Virtual Law Firm

**A full AI law firm you install as a skill. Not a chatbot — an org chart.**
GLAW runs legal *matters* (build a company, structure a fund, prosecute or defend a case, investigate fraud) through an **8-stage pipeline**, routing each step to the right **department**, and produces **attorney work-product** — pleadings, contracts, redlines, dossiers, filings — for a licensed attorney to review and sign.

## ⚡ TL;DR

```bash
# 1. install (clone into your Claude Code skills dir)
git clone https://github.com/rikitrader/glaw ~/.claude/skills/glaw
cd ~/.claude/skills/glaw && ./setup        # deploys 150 skills (88 native + 62 vendored seats) + tools

# 2. open a matter and let the firm work it
/glaw                                       # "form a Delaware C-corp with a SAFE round"
```

GLAW turns one prompt into a **staffed engagement**: intake → strategy → structure → draft → adversarial red-team → file → docket → close — with **hard gates** (conflicts cleared, citations verified, adversary survived, UPL disclaimer) it will not skip.

## 🤔 Why GLAW

Most "AI lawyer" tools are a single prompt that answers one question. A real firm doesn't work that way — it has **departments**, a **pipeline**, **partners who check the associates**, and **deliverables**.

GLAW models the firm:

- **It's an org chart, not a chat.** Work routes to the seat that owns it — a Tax question goes to Tax, a fund to Securities, a fraud pattern to the Investigations Bureau.
- **It produces documents, not opinions.** The output of a matter is a signature-ready packet: pleadings, formation docs, an offering memo, a redlined contract with real Word tracked-changes, a dossier.
- **It red-teams itself.** No matter reaches "file" until an adversarial pass (opposing counsel / IRS / SEC / trustee) has tried to destroy every position and a partner has verified the survivors.
- **It refuses to freelance.** Every position maps to a seat in a single source-of-truth roster. No gaps, no made-up authority.
- **It's auditable.** Every matter has a folder, a docket, a timeline, and a paper trail.

Built on the **gstack** skill-orchestration methodology: a meta-skill orchestrator + dozens of focused sub-skills, deployed as top-level `/commands`.

---

## 🏛️ The Departments

GLAW ships **88 native skills** organized into ten departments **plus 62 self-contained specialist seats** vendored under [`seats/`](seats/) — `glaw-corporate-counsel`, `glaw-pe-vc-counsel`, `glaw-tax-strategy`, `glaw-financial-forensics`, the `glaw-fs-*` finance models, and more. **Zero external skill dependencies:** every seat the firm routes to travels with the repo and is deployed by `./setup`. A deterministic gate (`glaw-doctor`) proves it — every routed skill resolves, or CI fails.

> The single source of truth for *who does what* is [`lib/firm-roster.md`](lib/firm-roster.md). Every stage consults it before drafting — that's the firm's no-gaps guarantee.

## 🔄 The Workflow

Every matter runs the same spine, branched into **three tracks** at intake:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    I["📥 Intake<br/>⛔ conflicts gate"] --> S["🎯 Strategy"] --> T["🏗️ Structure"] --> D["✍️ Draft"]
    D --> A["⚔️ Adversarial<br/>⛔ RED→BLUE gate"] --> F["📑 File<br/>⛔ citations gate"] --> K["🗓️ Docket"] --> C["✅ Close"]
    classDef stage fill:#0d1b2e,stroke:#3B82F6,color:#fff;
    classDef gate fill:#3a1414,stroke:#ef4444,color:#fff;
    class S,T,D,K,C stage
    class I,A,F gate
```

| Track | strategy = | structure = | draft = | adversarial = |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Litigation** (civil) | case theory | parties / claims map | pleadings & motions | opposing counsel red-team |
| **Corp / Fund build** | deal thesis | entity org chart + tax + cap table | formation / governance / offering docs | IRS + SEC + creditor red-team |
| **Investigation** (white-collar) | theory of wrongdoing | entity & flow-of-funds map | exposure matrix → complaint / referral | defense + prosecutor + judge red-team |

### 🚦 Four hard gates (never skipped)

1. **Conflicts cleared** before any substantive work (`/glaw-ethics-conflicts`).
2. **Citations verified** before filing (`/glaw-legal-research`) — the anti-hallucination guardrail.
3. **Adversarial RED → BLUE** before filing — a position the firm's own adversary destroys does not get filed.
4. **UPL disclaimer** on every external deliverable — GLAW produces *work-product*, not legal advice.

### 🕵️ The dossier escalation

When an investigation surfaces **red flags past threshold** (fraud tier, sanctions / securities / criminal hit), the Intelligence Super-Structure escalates from a routine briefing to a full **DOSSIER** — scored deterministically (`glaw-bureau-score`: a fraud 0–100 score + an FBI-style competency scorecard) and adversarially reviewed before it's relied on.

## 🧮 Bookkeeping engine

The Accounting department ships a self-contained, **deterministic, $0** bookkeeping engine
([`lib/bookkeeping/glaw_engine`](lib/bookkeeping)) — no LLM required for structured formats.

```bash
# any statement → categorized, balance-checked Google Sheet
glaw-bank-ingest statement.pdf --matter acme --chart roofing --format gsheet
#   PDF → opendataloader/Tesseract → engine (dedup + Golden-Rule verify) → chart → Sheet
```

- **6 structured formats** parsed deterministically + **digital & scanned PDFs** (OCR).
- **Golden-Rule check**: `opening + credits − debits == closing` → `verified` / `discrepancy`.
- **Bundled charts of accounts** (`--chart fund|roofing|personal`) or your own regex rules.
- Exports **hledger**, **beancount**, **json**, or a tabbed **Google Sheet**. Every row keeps an
  immutable hash + a `source_method` audit tag. Feeds `/glaw-financial-forensics`.

## 🚀 Install

**Requires** [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) (or any [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.org)-compatible agent).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rikitrader/glaw ~/.claude/skills/glaw
cd ~/.claude/skills/glaw
./setup
```

`./setup` deploys the 59 sub-skills as `/glaw-*` commands **plus the 62 vendored seats**, creates the state dir (`~/.glaw`), and (optionally) installs the Python toolbelt. The **core firm runs with zero dependencies**; the heavier tools want some extras:

| Capability | Needs |
|---|---|
| Citations / court scraping / Word redlines | `pip install -r requirements.txt` (a venv is fine) |
| PDF / Slides publishing | `pandoc`, `weasyprint` |
| OCR, doc extraction & scanned-PDF bookkeeping | `tesseract`, `poppler` (`pdftoppm`), Java + Apache Tika, `opendataloader-pdf` |

### 🔐 Environment & credentials (`.env`)

GLAW's **core needs no secrets** — matters, drafting, the pipeline, and structured-format
bookkeeping all run locally with nothing configured. A few *optional* enhancements read
credentials. Copy [`.env.example`](.env.example) → `.env` and set only what you use:

| Variable / file | Used by | For |
|---|---|---|
| `~/.gcp/token.json` (OAuth) | `glaw-bank-ingest --format gsheet`, `glaw-publish` | Google Sheets / Docs / Slides output |
| `BSP_HYBRID_MODEL` *(opt)* | bookkeeping PDF path | text-LLM for non-tabular PDFs (e.g. `ollama/llama3`) |
| `BSP_HYBRID_VISION_MODEL` *(opt)* | bookkeeping scans | vision model for image-only PDFs (default path is Tesseract, $0) |
| `COURTLISTENER_TOKEN` *(opt)* | `glaw-court-scrape` | higher CourtListener rate limits |
| `PROPUBLICA_API_KEY` *(opt)* | `glaw-exempt-org` | nonprofit / 990 lookups |

> **Never commit secrets.** `.env`, `*.key`, `*.pem`, `*.enc`, and token JSON are
> git-ignored, and `glaw-doctor [6/6]` **fails the build** if a live key, credential file,
> or real client data ever lands in the tree. GLAW ships **no** secrets and **no** personal data.

Then just talk to it:

```text
/glaw   →  "incorporate a FL holdco over my opco and lock down asset protection"
/glaw   →  "review the attached MSA from the customer's side and redline it"
/glaw   →  "investigate this counterparty for fraud and build a dossier if it's there"
```

Run `bin/glaw-doctor` any time to confirm the whole firm is healthy.

## ⚖️ NOT legal advice (read this)

GLAW produces **attorney work-product drafts for a licensed attorney to review, sign, and file.** It does **not** form an attorney-client relationship, does **not** practice law, and is **not** a substitute for a lawyer. Laws vary by jurisdiction and change; every output must be verified by qualified counsel before it is relied on or filed. The authors provide this software "as is," without warranty. See [LICENSE](LICENSE).

---

## 🧭 Where it's going

GLAW is evolving from a *firm* into a self-driving **AI agency** — an organism that senses a
situation, reasons across departments, drafts and acts, checks itself against its own
conscience (the gates), and learns. Next stops: an **Autonomy Core** (a goal-driven matter
loop + docket daemon), **harness integration** (an Extism plugin + conscience adoption for
autonomous runtimes like `zeroclaw-x0`, plus an MCP server), and new **branches** —
starting with **Constitutional Law** (`/glaw-constitutional`, `/glaw-legislative`,
`/glaw-admin-law`, `/glaw-judicial`). Throughout, one rule never bends: **the seal stays in
human hands** — GLAW prepares, a person commits.

**The organism loop** — how it thinks. The 4 gates are its conscience; matters are its memory. The seal stays in human hands: no autonomous path may file, charge, sanction, pay, or bind anyone.

## 🤝 Contributing

GLAW grows by adding **seats** (new SKILL.md departments) and **tools** (new CLIs) — never by letting a stage freelance a position. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). New skills must pass `bin/glaw-doctor`.

## 🔐 Security

GLAW ships **no secrets and no personal data**, and CI enforces it — `glaw-doctor [6/6]`
fails the build on any live key, credential file, or real client data. Keep matters under
`~/.glaw/` (git-ignored), never in the skill tree. Report vulnerabilities privately — see
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

third-party components (the Apache-2.0 bookkeeping engine, MIT seats) — each keeps its own
